# EF-Tools 🛠
This Git is work in progress. I have to refactor multiple tools and make sure they are ready to be used by everyone. 
Some tools will need personal adjusting to make sure it works for each company. 

### 📦 Revit Version 📦
These tools were developed on Revit 2019-2021.  
So in case you are using different version of Revit and having any issues,  
please let me know so I could adjust them to work on other versions too.

## 🚧WIP🚧 : 🎉 Release v1.0 🎉
This is the list of tools I want to refactor before I release them for all.  
Once I reach the state of the repo I am happy to be called V1.0 I will talk to pyRevit moderators to 
add it to the list of extensions.  

You are welcome to use them even now but you will need to modify extensions.json file in  
`%appdata%\pyRevit-Master\extensions\extensions.json`  
Contact me if you need help with this step.
