EF-Tools is a custom extension for pyRevit that contains multiple tools that might help you.  
Developed by **Erik Frits**

### üì¶ Revit Versions üì¶
These tools were developed mainly in Revit 2021.  
In case you are using different version of Revit and having any issues,  
please let me know so I could adjust them to work on other versions too.

##  üéâ Release v1.0 üéâ
I have contacted the creator of pyRevit - Ehsan Iran-Nejad, and he said that he will 
add my extension to pyRevit extensions with its next release by default.

You are welcome to use them right now but you will need to modify `extensions.json` file in `pyRevit-Master` manually.
Follow installation instructions below.

#### üí† Installation üí† 
1) Find `extensions.json` file that is normally saved in the path below by default:  
`%appdata%\pyRevit-Master\extensions\extensions.json`  
2) Open `extension.json` file in `pyRevit-Master\extensions\`. Once you open this .json file 
you will see a dictionary of other extensions. We will need to manually add information about EF-Tools here
3) Open [`extension.json`](https://github.com/ErikFrits/EF-Tools/blob/main/extension.json) file in my repo.
4) Add the content of my file to the `%appdata%\pyRevit-Master\extensions\extensions.json` so it 
matches the other extensions listed in there.
5) Restart your Revit. Once you open pyRevit -> Extensions you should be able to see EF-Tools displayed there. 
Just click on install and you should have your new favourite tools installed.

Contact me if you need help installing it.
