 A bend in a rebar shape has an angular range

    specified by one of these values. The angles refer to

    the angle swept out by one segment as it is bent

    relative to another. That is,an "Obtuse" bend results

    in two segments that meet at an angle that is less

    than 90 degrees when measured internally. Put another

    way,to create an equilateral triangle,you would need

    two "Obtuse" bends.
