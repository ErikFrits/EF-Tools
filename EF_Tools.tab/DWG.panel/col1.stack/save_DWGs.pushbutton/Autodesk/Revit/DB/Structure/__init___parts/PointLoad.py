  Create(aDoc: Document,host: AnalyticalModelStick,selector: AnalyticalElementSelector,forceVector: XYZ,momentVector: XYZ,symbol: PointLoadType) -> PointLoad

  

   Creates a new hosted point load within the project.

  

   aDoc: Document to which new point load will be added.

   host: The AnalyticalModelStick (Analytical Beam,Analytical Brace,Analytical Column) 

    host element for the point Load.

  

   selector: The start or end point of the Analytical stick element.

   forceVector: The applied 3d force vector.

   momentVector: The applied 3d moment vector.

   symbol: The symbol of the PointLoad. Set ll to use default type.

   Returns: If successful,returns the newly created PointLoad,ll otherwise.
