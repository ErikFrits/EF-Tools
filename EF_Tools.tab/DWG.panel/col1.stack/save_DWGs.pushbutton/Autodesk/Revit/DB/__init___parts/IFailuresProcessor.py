  ProcessFailures(self: IFailuresProcessor,data: FailuresAccessor) -> FailureProcessingResult

  

   Method that Revit will invoke to process failures at the end of transaction.

  

   data: Provides all necessary data to perform the resolution of failures.

   Returns: The result of the failures processing.

     Continue - Should be returned if 

    there were no failures or highest failure severity was "Warning" and all 

    warnings were deleted.

     If some failures are still present and "Continue" is 

    returned,it will be treated as "ProceedWithRollback".

     Note: If this method 

    has attempted to resolve failures,it should return "ProceedWithCommit"

     to 

    repeat end of transaction checks and failures processing.ProceedWithCommit - 

    End of transaction checks and failure processing will restart from the 

    beginning.

     If some failures were resolved,they will be removed and not 

    delivered to the user.

     ProceedWithCommit cannot be returned if transaction 

    is being rolled back.ProceedWithRollBack - Transaction will be rolled back 	

    even if Commit was originally requested.WaitForUserInput - Should be returned 

    if method has activated modeless user interaction and is waiting for an 

    external event

     (typically user input) to complete failures processing.
