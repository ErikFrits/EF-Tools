  """
  CreateSpiral(railCurve: Curve,t0: float,t1: float,radiusPoint: Point3d,pitch: float,turnCount: float,radius0: float,radius1: float,pointsPerTurn: int) -> NurbsCurve

  

   Create a C2 non-rational uniform cubic NURBS approximation of a swept helix or spiral.

  

   railCurve: The rail curve.

   t0: Starting portion of rail curve's domain to sweep along.

   t1: Ending portion of rail curve's domain to sweep along.

   radiusPoint: Point used only to get a vector that is perpedicular to the axis. In

     particular,

    this vector must not be (anti)parallel to the axis vector.

  

   pitch: The pitch. Positive values produce counter-clockwise orientation,

     negative values 

    produce clockwise orientation.

  

   turnCount: The turn count. If != 0,then the resulting helix will have this many

     turns. If=

    0,then pitch must be != 0 and the approximate distance

     between turns will be set 

    to pitch. Positive values produce counter-clockwise

     orientation,negitive values 

    produce clockwise orientation.

  

   radius0: The starting radius. At least one radii must benonzero. Negative values

     are allowed.

   radius1: The ending radius. At least ont radii must be nonzero. Negative values

     are allowed.

   pointsPerTurn: Number of points to intepolate per turn. Must be greater than 4.

     When in doubt,use 

    12.

  

   Returns: NurbsCurve on success,null on failure.

  CreateSpiral(axisStart: Point3d,axisDir: Vector3d,radiusPoint: Point3d,pitch: float,turnCount: float,radius0: float,radius1: float) -> NurbsCurve

  

   Creates a C1 cubic NURBS approximation of a helix or spiral. For a helix,

     you may 

    have radius0 == radius1. For a spiral radius0 == radius0 produces

     a circle. Zero 

    and negative radii are permissible.

  

  

   axisStart: Helix's axis starting point or center of spiral.

   axisDir: Helix's axis vector or normal to spiral's plane.

   radiusPoint: Point used only to get a vector that is perpedicular to the axis. In

     particular,

    this vector must not be (anti)parallel to the axis vector.

  

   pitch: The pitch,where a spiral has a pitch=0,and pitch > 0 is the distance

     between 

    the helix's "threads".

  

   turnCount: The number of turns in spiral or helix. Positive

     values produce counter-clockwise 

    orientation,negitive values produce

     clockwise orientation. Note,for a helix,

    turnCount * pitch=length of

     the helix's axis.

  

   radius0: The starting radius.

   radius1: The ending radius.

   Returns: NurbsCurve on success,null on failure.
