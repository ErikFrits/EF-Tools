  Create(curve: Curve) -> BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry

  

   Construct BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry based on any GCurve,including GLine and 

    GArc.

     The curve will be simplified if possible,and the concrete type of 

    the returned value will reflect

     that simplification: 

    BRepBuilderLinearEdgeGeometry if the curve could be simplified to a line,

     

    BRepBuilderArcEdgeGeometry if it could be simplified to an arc,

    BRepBuilderGenericCurveEdgeGeometry

     otherwise.

  

  

   curve: The 3D curve for this edge. This BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry stores a copy of the 

    input curve.

  

  Create(startPoint: XYZ,endPoint: XYZ) -> BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry

  

   Constructs a BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry representing a straight line between the 

    two given points.
