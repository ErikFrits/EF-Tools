   Creates a new unwrapped text note element with the given properties.

  

   document: A valid Revit document that is currently modifiable (i.e. with an open 

    transaction).

  

   viewId: Id of the graphic view in which the note is to be created.

   position: A model position of the new note.

     Note that the position's relation to the 

    text's bounding box depends on the requested text alignment

     (set via the 

    Options argument). It will be the box' top-left corner for a left-aligned text,


    
     the top-right corner for a right-aligned text,and middle-top point if the

    transaction).

  

   viewId: Id of the graphic view in which the note is to be created.

   position: A model position of the new note.

     For a left-aligned text (default),the 

    origin is set at the top-left corner of the note's bounding box.

   Creates a new line-wrapping text note element of the given width and properties.

    transaction).

    text is to be centered.

  

   width: Width [ft] of the text in paper space (i.e. as it is measured when printed.)

    

     If a line of text is longer than the given specified Width,the text will be 

    automatically wrapped.

     If a a zero Width is supplied then this method will
